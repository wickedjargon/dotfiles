# If I switch to wayland, these are the packages I'll be transitioning to:

dwl – the main graphical environment (dwm replacement)
foot – the terminal (st replacement)
keyd – keyboard remapping daemon
dwlb + someblocks – statusbar (dwmblocks replacement)
bemenu or wmenu - incremental dropdown menu (dmenu replacement)
swayimg – image viewer

# these stay the same:

zsh – the shell
firefox – browser
zathura – pdf reader
mpv – video player
ncmpcpp – music
htop – to look cool in screencaps… err… system monitor
